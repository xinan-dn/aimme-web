That means they should not upload videos they didn\u2019t make or use content in their videos that someone else owns the copyright to, such as music tracks, snippets of copyrighted programs, or videos made by other users, without necessary authorizations\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to avoid copyright infringement strikes, follow these simple rules:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>No use of copyrighted images, videos or visuals unless you have permission (giving credit is NOT sufficient)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>No use of copyrighted music or lyrics without permission<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What happens when you get a strike?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you get a <strong>copyright strike <\/strong>from YouTube, you will be notified. It is important that you <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/youtube\/answer\/2814000?hl=en#zippy=%2Cwhat-happens-when-you-get-a-copyright-strike%2Ccourtesy-period%2Chow-to-get-info-about-your-strike%2Cresolve-a-copyright-strike\">resolve<\/a> it as soon as you can. If you get 3 active copyright strikes, YouTube can decide to terminate your channel, delete all your videos and forbid you from creating any channel in the future \u274c<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/youtube\/answer\/2802032?hl=en#:~:text=Community%20Guidelines%20are%20the%20rules,complaint%20or%20a%20court%20order.\"><strong>Community Guidelines strikes<\/strong><\/a> will also be notified to you, YouTube will tell you what content was removed, which policies it violated, how it affects your channel and what you can do next. First violation of community guidelines should result in a simple warning, but YouTube reserves the right to terminate your channel directly in case of severe abuse.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following strikes will be associated with temporarily restricted use of YouTube, and 3 strikes within a 90-day period will lead to permanent removal of your channel \ud83d\ude35<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Applying to the YouTube Partners Program<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you\u2019ve hit the thresholds, you will be eligible to apply to the YouTube Partners Program! We strongly encourage you to set up your Google AdSense account before being eligible to speed up the process.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Application will be reviewed by YouTube within a 30-day period.

You can reapply after 30 days, and you can use this time to review your channel to ensure your next application is successful. A few pieces of advice here:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Review your content (videos, titles, descriptions, thumbnails and tags) against&nbsp; <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/youtube\/answer\/1311392\">YouTube monetisation policies<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/yt\/about\/policies\/#community-guidelines\">Community Guidelines<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delete or edit videos and thumbnails which may violate YouTube\u2019s policies<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Amend your titles, descriptions and tags accordingly<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Maintain your YouTube Partner status<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To maintain your YouTube Partner status, stay away from strikes and keep your channel active! \ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2642\ufe0fYouTube may turn off monetization on channels that haven\u2019t uploaded a video or posted to the Community tab for 6 months or more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">YouTube Shorts<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2021, YouTube introduced its first Creator Funds, the YouTube Short Fund, aiming at boosting short-form content on their platform. YouTube pledged $100M for creators. Let\u2019s look at how to get a piece of it! \ud83d\udcb0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How does the YouTube Shorts Fund work?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Every month, YouTube directly reaches out to creators which are eligible for a bonus based on their channel\u2019s Shorts\u2019 performance in the previous month.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>YouTube doesn\u2019t disclose a formula to figure out how much you can make, calculations are constantly changing so it is quite difficult to get accurate data. YouTube states that the level of performance needed is based on various factors, including the location of your viewers and the overall growth of Shorts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to be eligible for a bonus from the YouTube Shorts Fund?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>YouTube Shorts bonuses are available to all content creators, no need to be a part of the YouTube Partner Program. Here\u2019s the list of criteria:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/youtube\/answer\/7101720?hl=en\">Eligible country of residence&nbsp;<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Get a Google AdSense account linked to your YouTube channel<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Minimum age is 13 for U.S. citizens, majority is required in all other countries<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Compliance with <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/youtube\/answer\/9288567\">Community Guidelines<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/youtube\/answer\/1311392\">YouTube channel monetization policies<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/intl\/en_us\/howyoutubeworks\/policies\/copyright\/\">Copyright Policy<\/a><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Video should not have a watermark or logo from another social media platform<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Video should be original, videos from other channels or media (TV shows, movies) will be ineligible<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Channel needs to have uploaded at least one eligible Short in the last 180 days<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">YouTube Channel Membership<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>YouTube Channel Memberships are monthly paid subscriptions to your channel. It is a way for your fans to reward you and get access to exclusive perks. You can enable different levels of memberships which will give your members access to different perks depending on the pricing, such as exclusive content, custom emojis, badges or live chat access. Pricing will vary depending on the creator and the country, in all cases, YouTube gets a 30% share.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to be eligible?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To access this feature, your channel must meet certain <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/youtube\/answer\/7636690?hl=en\">requirements<\/a>. You need to be over 18, live in an eligible country of residence, make content that is not \u201cmade for kids\u201d and have at least 1,000 subscribers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">YouTube Super Features<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re doing livestreams on YouTube and are part of the YouTube Partners Program, Super Features can be an extra revenue stream for you and a way for you and your community to connect. Your fans can simply buy these Super Chats and Super Stickers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Super Chats allows your audience to get their message featured in the livestream chat, and Super Stickers are fun stickers that are pinned to the top of the chat so the creator can notice them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to activate these Super Features, you just have to turn them on in your Monetization tab. And of course, get on with your livestreams!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"941\" height=\"779\" src=\"https:\/\/creasquare.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/youtube-superchat.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15924\" srcset=\"https:\/\/creasquare.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/youtube-superchat.png 941w, https:\/\/creasquare.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/youtube-superchat-300x248.png 300w, https:\/\/creasquare.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/youtube-superchat-768x636.png 768w, https:\/\/creasquare.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/youtube-superchat-440x364.png 440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 941px) 100vw, 941px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">YouTube Premium<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Wait, if there are no ads, how are creators getting paid? No worries, revenue from YouTube Premium membership fees is distributed to YouTube Partner Program video Creators, based on how much members watch their content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">YouTube BrandConnect<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another YouTube invention, with yet another way to monetize. YouTube BrandConnect connects brands with YouTube creators for their branded content campaigns. The advantage for creators is that they can choose who they are working with and retain creative control!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the moment, YouTube BrandConnect is only available in the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada. Only creators monetizing with the YouTube Partners Program are eligible. Unfortunately, YouTube BrandConnect is invite-only and will select channels, let\u2019s hope it gets more accessible soon! \ud83d\ude4f<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>We hope you enjoyed this article and got some useful information out of it!
